Notes:
	- This is also my 'learning ruby' project. Please don't make fun of the
	  full-retard mode coding you'll see here. 


Progress:
	- The file I/O framework is in place, not too much more.
	- LCS algorithm is functioning properly

Other:
	- How will we determine if lines are moved as opposed to characters
    	  inside of lines? Do a search across all remaining lines for the longest 	    common subsequence? That seems inefficient and possibly flawed.
